These units were performed for the partial fulfilment of one of the course in my masters degree. These units were designed in order to get familiar with communication busses, electronic control units, and little bit with AUTOSAR.

1. Unit (Introduction):
To get to know the Board
2. Unit (CAN1): 
Easy CAN, Connection ECU/PC, R/W CAN
3. Unit (CAN2):
Teamwork, Bus-System CAN
4. Unit(AUTOSAR):
AUTOSAR Application
5. Unit (Test): 
Black Box Test ECU, manual an automatic

# Initial Steps
To implement functions on the ECU, the "Raisonance Ride7" IDE is used. For flashing code to the board "Rflasher7" is used.
The compiler must be started by opening "WindRiver -> Development Shell"
